# Borderlands 3 Save Editor

A tool to help you modify your Borderlands 3 Saves and Profiles.

Currently it runs on Windows, Mac OS and Linux. It supports modifying PC saves as well as decrypted PS4 saves.

# How to use

Visit https://github.com/ZakisM/bl3_save_edit/releases and download the corresponding version for your platform.

Unzip and open the editor, then double click to run it. On the first start it will ask you to point it to the
folder/directory where your saves/profiles are stored. Once you have pointed it to a valid folder it will remember this
folder the next time you open the program.

# Notices

I recommend you make your own backups before using this editor, however the editor will also make backups for you before
saving.
